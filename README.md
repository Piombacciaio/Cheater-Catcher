# Cheater catcher

This is a little game where 20 agents compete throwing a coin in the air to get "heads"
One of them is a cheater and has a weighted cointo get heads more often
The 3 difficulty levels modify how often the cheater gets "heads" making him harder to spot
Knowing how many times each agent got "heads" your objective is to find the cheater in as less tries and time as possible to get a higher score
There is a limited number of lives before failing the run
